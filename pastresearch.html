            <h2>1. The effect of listening to music on concentration...</h2>
            <p>Listening to music while studying has become a usual practice in the student population. While one group of students claim it would enhance their curricular efficiency, on the other hand, some researchers deny such assumptions. The overall objective of the study was to explore the effect of music on the curricular activity of the student and whether this trend is to rule out it is beneficial to the students in their academic performances. Present study involved 200 Malaysian students representing three major ethnicities. Among them, 120 students prefer to listen to music while studying and remaining 80 were not. The study comprised of two ways of survey namely questionnaire based and experiment based. Data obtained from the responses of participants compiled in the form of graphs and charts 47% believes that music helps them to concentrate while studying. 29% claims that music would keep their mind calm, and 17% stated that it would prevent sleepiness. 78 out of 80 students said that listening to music while studying distract their concentration. Experimental data revealed higher incidence (75%) of correct answers while listening to soft music than other fast track or instrumental music. The positive finding as obtained from the study is relevant to justify the current trend of listening to music while studying as it may not pose any adverse effects on the concentration of student. In fact, it might also improve the performance of the student in their academic perspectives.</p>

            <h2>2. Music and memory: effects of listening to music while studying...</h2>
            <p>Thirty-nine college students participated in an experiment that tested their memory for a text that they studied while in one of the three different auditory settings. Participants were randomly assigned to study a text in silence or while listening to either popular music or classical music. Previous studies have shown mixed performance effects of listening to music while studying a text. The current experiment focused on how college students enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Stout performed on a test of memory after studying a text in varying auditory environments. The results demonstrated that college students recall more content after listening to pop music or silence during study when compared to classical music.</p>

            <h2>3. Eye movements and reading comprehension while listening...</h2>
            <p>In the present study 24 university students read four different texts in four conditions: (1) while listening to music they preferred to listen to while studying; (2) while listening to music they did not prefer to listen to while studying; (3) while listening to a recording of noise from a café; and finally (4) in silence. After each text they took a reading-comprehension test. Eye movement data were recorded for all participants in all conditions.
A main effect for the reading-comprehension scores revealed that the participants scored significantly lower after they had been listening to the non-preferred music while reading, compared with reading in silence. No significant effects were found between the other conditions. No significant differences between conditions were found for the traditional eye movement measures in reading (fixation duration, saccadic amplitude, regressions, and first-pass and second-pass reading time). It is suggested that this result is a consequence of participants not being aware that their reading processes are disrupted by a non-preferred musical background. They do not make the necessary changes to the processes involved in reading required to compensate for increased cognitive load. The results are discussed in relation to study/reading habits, extraversion, arousal and working memory capacity.</p>

            <h2>4. Influence of music on the solution of mathematical logical tasks</h2>
            <p>Musical accompaniment (of different styles and intensities) of the solution of mathematical logical tasks influenced the time required for their solution. Classical music 35 and 65 dB and rock music 65 and 85 dB in terms of loudness decreased the time of the solution. Louder classical music (85 dB) did not have this effect. Solution of tasks without musical accompaniment led to an increase in coherent values, especially in β1, β2, and γ the frequency bands in the EEG of the occipital cortex. The intrahemispheric and interhemispheric coherences of frontal EEG increased and EEG asymmetry (in the number of Coh connections in the left and right hemispheres) arose during the solution of the tasks accompanied by music. Classical music (35 and 65 dB) caused left-side asymmetry in the EEG. The use of more powerful classical or rock music led to a prevalence of the number of Coh connections in the right hemisphere.</p>

            <h2>5. Happy creativity: Listening to happy music facilitates divergent thinking</h2>
            <p>Creativity can be considered one of the key competencies for the twenty-first century. It provides us with the capacity to deal with the opportunities and challenges that are part of our complex and fast-changing world. The question as to what facilitates creative cognition—the ability to come up with creative ideas, problem solutions and products—is as old as the human sciences, and various means to enhance creative cognition have been studied. Despite earlier scientific studies demonstrating a beneficial effect of music on cognition, the effect of music listening on creative cognition has remained largely unexplored. The current study experimentally tests whether listening to specific types of music (four classical music excerpts systematically varying on valance and arousal), as compared to a silence control condition, facilitates divergent and convergent creativity. Creativity was higher for participants who listened to ‘happy music’ (i.e., classical music high on arousal and positive mood) while performing the divergent creativity task, than for participants who performed the task in silence. No effect of music was found for convergent creativity. In addition to the scientific contribution, the current findings may have important practical implications. Music listening can be easily integrated into daily life and may provide an innovative means to facilitate creative cognition in an efficient way in various scientific, educational and organizational settings when creative thinking is needed.</p>
